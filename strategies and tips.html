                <h2>Key Strategies</h2>
                
                <h3>Rad Kardan (Passing)</h3>
                <p>If you don't have a card in the suit being played, you can either pass (Rad Kardan) or play a trump card. Passing can be a smart move, allowing you to save your strong cards for later. It's about knowing when to hold back and when to jump in.</p>

                <h3>Bluffing</h3>
                <p>Bluffing is a key part of Hokm. You can play cards in a way that makes your opponents think you have a stronger or weaker hand than you actually do. For example, playing a low card from a suit you're weak in can trick your opponents into thinking you're out of that suit, when you're really just setting them up for a big surprise.</p>

                <h3>Kot (Winning 7-0)</h3>
                <p>Kot is a rare and powerful strategy where one team wins all 7 tricks while the other team wins none. If you pull this off, you earn 2 rounds instead of just 1. It requires a perfect hand and a lot of teamwork, but it can completely shift the game in your favor.</p>

                <h3>Hakem Koti (Hakem's 0-7)</h3>
                <p>Hakem Koti happens when the team of the Hakem loses all 7 tricks, and the opposing team wins all of them. This is a huge blow because the team that won 7 tricks gets 3 rounds instead of 1. It's something the Hakem's team definitely wants to avoid, so it's important to play carefully and use your trump suit when needed.</p>

                <h3>Hokm Lazem (Trump Suit Required)</h3>
                <p>Sometimes, you'll need to use the Hokm (trump suit) to win a crucial trick. The Hokm beats all other suits, so don't hesitate to use it when the stakes are high to secure a win.</p>

                <h3>Boridan (Sacrificing Cards)</h3>
                <p>Boridan is a tactic you can use when you don't have a card in the suit being played. If you have the same suit that's being played, you must follow suit and play that card. However, if you don't have any cards in that suit, you can perform the Boridan trick by playing a trump card from the Hokm suit. Since the Hokm suit is the highest ranking, your card will win the trick, even if it's not the same suit being played.</p>
