                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <p>The game starts the same way as in the 4-player version, where a Hakem is chosen.</p>
                <p>1. After choosing the Hokm, the dealer gives 5 cards to each player.</p>
                <p>2. The Hakem must discard 3 cards, and the other player must discard 2 cards before the game begins.</p>
                <p>After all cards are drawn, each player should have 13 cards. The Hakem starts the game, and the gameplay follows the same rules as the 4-player version.</p>

                        <p class="answer">All remaining cards are placed in the middle as a draw pile. The process works as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>For the Hakem:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Draw the top card - they can choose to keep it</li>
                                    <li>If they don't want it, they must discard it and draw a second card, which they must keep (no choice)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>For the other player:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>They can choose to keep the first card they draw</li>
                                    <li>However, they must see the second card and discard it if they already kept the first one</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Since each player burns two cards per turn, they take a risk—either keeping the first card or hoping the second one is better.</p>
