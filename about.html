        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey, I’m Zhina. I was born and raised in Iran, where our traditional card game is Hokm. I can remember being a little kid, watching my whole family play Hokm together—they took it *so* seriously. Especially my grandpa. The second he realized he was losing, he’d throw all his cards on the floor and leave. Definitely not part of the rules, lol.

            As I grew up, I got obsessed with the game. I’d beg my friends to get together just so we could play. When I was a teenager, I found this small park in our neighborhood where all the grandpas and random people would sit and play Hokm. That’s when I was like, “okay wait, I found my place.” I’d sit there and play all day—it got to the point where my mom was seriously worried I was becoming a gambler, hahah.
            
            Anyway, this is my first website, and I thought, why not turn this lifelong obsession into something creative? So here it is—a space to learn how to play Hokm and (hopefully) enjoy it as much as I do.</p>
