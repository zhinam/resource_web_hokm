                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <p>After all players have their cards, the Hakem starts the game by playing a card of their choice in the middle. The next player, sitting to the right of the Hakem, must play a card of the same suit as the one the Hakem played.</p>
                <p>The game continues clockwise, with each player playing one card. The player with the highest-ranking card wins the trick for their team. That player then starts the next round by playing the first card.</p>
                <p>This process repeats until a team reaches 7 points, winning the round.</p>

                        <p class="answer">They have two choices:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Rad Kardan</strong> – This means passing or basically not doing anything in the game. A player can only do this if they don't have a card in the suit that is being played. In this case, they must play a random card from their hand.</li>
                            <li><strong>Play a trump suit card</strong> (the Hokm chosen by the Hakem), which has the highest rank among all suits.</li>
